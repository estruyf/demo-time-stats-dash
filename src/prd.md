- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Minimal interface to emphasize data visualization

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with strategic accent colors
- **Primary Color**: Deep blue (#1e40af) - represents trust and professionalism
- **Secondary Colors**: Lighter blues for supporting elements
- **Accent Color**: Green (#10b981) for positive trends, red (#ef4444) for negative ones
- **Color Psychology**: Blues convey trust and stability, perfect for data visualization
- **Color Accessibility**: All color combinations meet WCAG AA contrast standards
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**:
  - Background: Light gray (#f8fafc) with Dark text (#1e293b)
  - Card: White (#ffffff) with Dark text (#1e293b)
  - Primary: Deep blue (#1e40af) with White text (#ffffff)
  - Secondary: Light blue (#93c5fd) with Dark text (#1e293b)
  - Accent: Green (#10b981) with White text (#ffffff)
  - Muted: Very light gray (#f1f5f9) with Medium gray text (#64748b)

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Sans-serif throughout for clean, modern appearance
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headings, labels, and values
- **Font Personality**: Professional, clean, highly legible
- **Readability Focus**: Optimized spacing and font sizes for dashboard context
- **Typography Consistency**: Consistent type treatment across all metrics
- **Which fonts**: Inter for headings, Open Sans for body text
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts are highly legible at various sizes

### Visual Hierarchy & Layout
- **Attention Direction**: Key metrics at top, followed by chart, then detailed table
- **White Space Philosophy**: Generous spacing to prevent visual overload
- **Grid System**: Card-based layout with consistent spacing
- **Responsive Approach**: Stack cards vertically on smaller screens
- **Content Density**: Balanced to show sufficient data without overwhelming

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle transitions when data loads or changes
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Chart animations to emphasize data changes
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal loading animations for professional context

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Component Usage**: Cards for metric groups, tabs for data view switching
- **Component Customization**: Subtle shadows and rounded corners for cards
- **Component States**: Clear hover and active states for interactive elements
- **Icon Selection**: Simple, recognizable icons for each metric type
- **Component Hierarchy**: Key metrics cards > Chart > Data table
- **Spacing System**: Consistent 4-point spacing system using Tailwind's scale
- **Mobile Adaptation**: Stacked layout with scrollable chart on mobile

### Visual Consistency Framework
- **Design System Approach**: Component-based design for consistency
- **Style Guide Elements**: Colors, typography, spacing, and component styles
- **Visual Rhythm**: Consistent card sizing and spacing
- **Brand Alignment**: Professional appearance aligned with developer tools

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text and data visualization elements

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios
- **Potential Obstacles**: Missing data for certain days or metrics
- **Edge Case Handling**: Graceful display of incomplete or missing data
- **Technical Constraints**: API response timing and potential failures

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Could be expanded to compare multiple extensions
- **Testing Focus**: Verify correct data display and responsiveness
- **Critical Questions**: How to best visualize multiple metrics on a single chart?

## Reflection
- This approach emphasizes clarity and insights, which is perfect for analytical data.
- We're assuming users primarily want to track trends rather than perform complex analysis.
- What would make this exceptional is adding predictive trends or comparative benchmarks.
